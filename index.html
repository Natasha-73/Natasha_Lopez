                            <p>
                            Hi, my name is Natasha and I am originally from Trinidad and Tobago. I have however lived in the United Kingdom for 12 years and
                            returned to Trinidad in 2018. I have found myself back in the United Kingdom at the moment for short term employment. Ideally however,
                            I'd like to make my way back to Trinidad because as they say, there is no place like home!
                            </p>			
                            <p>
                            Most of my experience is as a process engineer where I find that solving problems and troubleshooting motivate me 
                            in addition to learning new things. Recently I've started learning software engineering and find in this field, I also enjoy 
                            solving problems within coding, understanding why things work or most times, why things don't work. 
                            </p>

                            <p> 
                            I like to keep learning new things and support any industry that I work in with my passion to solve problems. I recently picked up 
                            a new hobby which challenges my problem solving skills. It is making houses out of matchsticks. The main challenge is to translate 
                            how a builder may build a real house into building with matchsticks. I designed the house myself so there are no plans beyond the ones
                            I created to make the matchsticks work. And if that is of any interest to you, scroll down to the end of my webpage to see a picture.

                            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                        
                            <p>
                            I am a chartered process engineer with over 20 yearsâ€™ experience in both design and operational engineering within the upstream 
                            oil and gas and methanol synthesis industries. 
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            I worked as a plant process engineer in a Methanol Synthesis plant for 7 years where I monitored and optimised the process, carried
                            out equipment and catalyst evaluations, troubleshot issues that arose on the plant and solved process related problems. I moved
                            into the upstream oil and gas industry in a similar operations role for onshore and offshore facilities.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            In 2006 I expanded my experience into design engineering where I learnt to design the equipment and processes needed to separate 
                            process fluids, condition and transport them to downstream facilities. I carried out flare studies, process calculations such as 
                            line and equipment sizing, process simulations, Process and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) preparation and datasheet preparation. 
                            </p>
                            
                            <p> 
                            In the way of varied exposure, I have worked offshore in the North Sea for commissioning of Floating Process Storage and Offloading
                            (FPSO) facility. I have also visited rural Mozambique as part of an Environmental Impact Assessment for an onshore oil and gas facility.

                            This program is a project management system for a fictious civil engineering company. It is an initial submission for 
                            managing project to be completed by the company. The program uses Object Oriented Programming in Java where projects 
                            and the people associated with the project are objects. The user of the program can add new project, add new persons, 
                            update the details of the project and the users and generate invoices when the project is finalised.
